## GitOps using Flux and Azure Container Registry

This repo contains two hello-world applications written in FastAPI and Flask, focusing the configuration in the fastapi app.

The application code is in the `app` folder, and all the flux related files in `infra`.

Inside each folder there is a README explaining how to execute each setup. In Flux's example, there are some scripts that automate the creation of K8s clusters with kind, and the installation of Flux in them.
